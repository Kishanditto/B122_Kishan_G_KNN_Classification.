K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is a classification algorithm that is used to classify data points based on their proximity to other data points. It works by finding the K nearest data points to a given data point and assigning it the class that is most common among those K nearest neighbors.

In the context of the Iris dataset, the KNN algorithm is used to classify iris plants into three different species (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica) based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the species of a new iris plant based on its measurements.

The first step in building a KNN model is to import and prepare the data. This involves importing the dataset using pandas and then dividing the dataset into two arrays: X (features) and y (labels). The X array contains the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of each iris flower, while the y array contains the corresponding species of each iris flower.

Next, the LabelEncoder class from the sklearn.preprocessing module is used to transform the categorical labels into numerical values. This is necessary because the KNN algorithm only works with numerical data.

After preparing the data, the next step is to split the dataset into a training set and a test set using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module. The training set is used to train the KNN model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

Lastly, data visualization is done to better understand the data by creating a scatter plot matrix using the seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot modules. This helps to identify any patterns or relationships between the different features and the target variable (species) in the data.
