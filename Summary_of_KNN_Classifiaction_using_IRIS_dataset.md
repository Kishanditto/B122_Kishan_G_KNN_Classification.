KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) classification is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding the k closest data points in the feature space to a given data point, and then assigning the label of the majority class among those k neighbors to the new data point.

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning, often used as a benchmark for testing classification algorithms. It consists of 150 instances of iris flowers, each with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and 3 possible classes (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica).

To perform KNN classification on the Iris dataset, we can divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the KNN classifier, while the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the classifier.
