Summary

The project aimed to classify whether a patient has diabetes or not based on medical predictor variables using KNN classification. The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset was used, which included medical measurements of Pima Indian women and a binary target variable. The preprocessing phase included loading the dataset using the open function, determining the data types, and converting the data types to integers or floats if possible. The missing or null values in the dataset were calculated, and the rows with age 0 were removed. The summary statistics of the dataset were calculated, and the dataset was normalized. Finally, the means, stds, mins, and maxs of each column were calculated and displayed in a table format. No pandas, numpy, and sklearn libraries were used in the preprocessing phase.
